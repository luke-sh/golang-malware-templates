# Go malware templates
Collection of some of my templates for malware development or improvement. Many more coming with time as I happen to need them.

## Templates and description ahead

### "afternotepad.go"
- Tries to inject shellcode in each process in a customizable list after notepad, shown with whatever message you want on it, is closed.

### "Text_eXploit_uTility.go" aka TXT
- Simple utilty to hide executables to most human eyes.
- Usage: go run Text_eXploit_uTility.go myexecutable.exe .txt (where .txt is the custom spoofed extension, you can choose whatever you want)
